var findNumberOfLIS = function (nums) {

//? Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
//? Output: 2
//? Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequences are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].

//? Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
//? Output: 5
//? Explanation: The length of the longest increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 increasing subsequences of length 1, so output 5.
